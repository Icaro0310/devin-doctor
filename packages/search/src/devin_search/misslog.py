"""Local query log — the objective trigger for SE-1 (semantic search).

Every ``query`` run appends one JSON line to ``<index>.queries.jsonl``:
``{ts, term, filters, hits}`` — never message content, never paths from
results. ``misses`` aggregates it into a per-month count of searches
that returned zero hits; if lexical search misses often, that is the
evidence that a semantic index (SE-1) is worth building.

The log lives next to the index file, is append-only, and stays local.
