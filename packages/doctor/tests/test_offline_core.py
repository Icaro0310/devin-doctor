"""Offline-core guard: the core must not open sockets.

Release checklist item: "no-network core test (CI): fails if the core
opens a socket". An autouse fixture monkeypatches ``socket.socket.connect``,
``socket.socket.connect_ex`` and ``socket.create_connection`` to raise
``OfflineCoreError`` for the duration of every test in this file, then the
tests run the repo's core operations end to end. This is a guard, not a
mock: any in-process network access fails the suite.

Intentional online paths are excluded by design: ``capabilities
--probe-network`` performs one documented TCP connect and is an explicit
opt-in flag — the capability profile is fail-closed without it, which is
exactly what this guard verifies.

Opt-out: mark a test ``@pytest.mark.network`` to run it without the socket
block (reserved for tests that intentionally exercise the network).

Run with:
``PYTHONPATH=src:../devin-internals-spec/src python -m pytest tests/test_offline_core.py``
(this repo imports ``devin_internals`` from the sibling checkout).
