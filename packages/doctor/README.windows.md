# devin-explore — Personal Windows guide

This guide covers unrestricted Windows setup. For restricted machines, see [README.corporate-windows.md](README.corporate-windows.md); for features, shared commands, limitations, and the safety model, see [README.md](README.md).

Personal Windows uses the extended runtime: local execution plus optional Devin VM/QwenPaw delegation when this artifact supports it.

## Prerequisites

- `uv` and Python 3.10 or newer; `uv` can manage Python.

## Install

Install the isolated Python CLI:

```powershell
uv tool install "devin-doctor"
```

## Devin paths

Session data normally lives under `%APPDATA%\devin\cli\`; UI state and ACP stores under `%APPDATA%\Devin\User\`.
Use the tool's documented `--data-dir` or `--config-dir` flags for non-default locations.

## Environment notes

- Delegated runtime is optional; this guide installs local tooling only.
- Corporate Windows is a separate local-only environment.
- macOS is planned but not claimed as tested.

## Personal Windows specifics

- **Python:** `uv` manages its own Python, which also avoids the Microsoft Store `python.exe` alias stub (it opens the Store instead of running). If you install Python from python.org anyway, tick "Add python.exe to PATH".
- **Shell:** PowerShell 7 + Windows Terminal is the recommended setup; every command also works in `cmd.exe` and Windows PowerShell 5.1 — none require admin.
- **Install location:** executables live under `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`; data under `%APPDATA%\devin`. Nothing touches `Program Files` or the registry.
- **WSL:** treat it as a Linux machine — follow [README.linux.md](README.linux.md) inside it.
- **Uninstall:** `uv tool uninstall <package>` (or `npm uninstall -g` for a Node.js tool) removes the CLI; delete `%APPDATA%\devin` to remove local data. No services or scheduled tasks are left behind.

## Recurring runs (optional)

_Weekly health sweep — read-only, safe to leave on._

```powershell
schtasks /create /tn "devin-explore" /tr "devin-doctor check" /sc daily /st 04:00 /f
```

Runs under your account — no admin needed. Adjust `/sc`/`/st` (or `/sc onlogon` for daemons) to taste.



## Adapters (MCP / Devin skill / plugin)

- MCP server: `pip install 'devin-doctor[mcp]'` then run
  `devin-doctor-mcp` (stdio). Read-only tools only.
- Devin plugin + skill: `devin plugins install
  Icaro0310/devin-explore#packages/doctor/adapters`. The manifest
  launches the server through `uvx --from 'devin-doctor[mcp]'
  devin-doctor-mcp`, which resolves once the matching PyPI release
  ships. Until then, an editable install does not change what
  `uvx --from` resolves — either run the source-installed
  `devin-doctor-mcp` directly, or point a local manifest copy at the
  checkout: `uvx --from './packages/doctor[mcp]' devin-doctor-mcp`.

## Troubleshooting

- If a command is not found, reopen PowerShell and run `uv tool update-shell`.
