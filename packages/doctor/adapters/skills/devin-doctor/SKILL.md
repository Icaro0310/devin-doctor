# devin-doctor

When the user reports a Devin installation error, corrupted stores, odd
session behavior, or asks whether the environment is healthy, diagnose
before guessing:

```bash
devin-doctor check --json
```

Or, when this plugin's MCP server is connected, call the `doctor_check`
tool — it returns the same JSON payload.

## Reading the result

- `overall` is `PASS`/`WARN`/`FAIL`; `findings[]` carries one entry per
  check with `status`, `message` and an optional `fix` suggestion.
- `FAIL` findings explain what is actually broken — report them with
  their `fix` text. `WARN` findings are worth mentioning, not alarming.
- If the JSON contains `error`, the tool could not run (bad path,
  missing store) — say so instead of inventing a diagnosis.

## Rules

- Read-only by design. There is no fix/apply command — never improvise
  one. Present `fix` suggestions for the user to approve and run
  themselves.
- Point `--data-dir`/`--config-dir` at the user's actual Devin
  directories when they are non-standard; otherwise let the tool use the
  platform defaults.
- `--stale-days N` controls how long a session must be inactive before
  it counts as stale (default 30).
