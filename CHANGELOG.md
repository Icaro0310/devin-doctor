# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **CI** — `auto-approve` now re-runs the shared gate on
  `pull_request_review[submitted]` and on the `Devin Review` commit
  `status` success, so clean analyses and late reviews no longer strand
  PRs in REVIEW_REQUIRED.
- **Docs** — refreshed the generated `Part of the DEVIN ecosystem` block: journey recuration v2 (six paths, zero repeats, `Local-first ops` label, `devin-bridge` in DevOps).
- **Docs** — ecosystem journey recuration applied (six curated audiences); stale `Path:` lines removed from the devin-doctor eco-block, which is not a registry entry.
- **CI** — Ruff lint job added (`astral-sh/ruff-action`, pinned); `legacy/`
  migration scripts excluded from the shipped lint scope.
- **Publish** — consolidated `pypi-publish.yml` builds and uploads
  `devin-doctor`, `devin-graph`, `devin-history`, `devin-pm` and
  `devin-search` via PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC), tag `*-v*` or
  manual dispatch.
- **Fix** — `devin-pm` resolves `sessions.db` across `XDG_DATA_HOME`,
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `~` candidates, matching the rest of the
  ecosystem.
- **Fix** — `devin-history` timestamps are timezone-aware (`DTZ006`).
